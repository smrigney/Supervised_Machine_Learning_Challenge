# Supervised_Machine_Learning_Challenge

For this challenge I have only uploaded My code in the Credit Risk Evaluator. I normally push everything I have to github, but for some reason it is not allowing me to do so, even with the help of .gitattributes LFS. I am going to reach out to Jen Senna to let her know, and I have already spoke to my professor Chris Wimble.
